# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the The Natural Design repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, The LMU Munich employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because The LMU Munich holds the copyright.
#
# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address>
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN>
#
# Please keep the list sorted.
